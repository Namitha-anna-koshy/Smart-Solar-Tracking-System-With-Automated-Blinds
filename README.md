# 🌞 Smart Solar Tracking System with Automated Blind Control
*aka the project where the sun finally listened to me*

Welcome to my minor mini project — the era where I went from  
**“why did I even take this minor 😭”**  
to  
**“ok wait… this is actually kinda fire 🔥.”**

This system tracks the sun like it has a crush on it, and the blinds open/close automatically like they run on mood swings.  
Powered by Arduino UNO (my emotional-support microcontroller).

## ✨ What This Project Does
- Tracks the sun for max solar efficiency  
- Moves the panel automatically using LDR readings  
- Blinds **close** when the sunlight gets too bright  
- Blinds **open** when the intensity drops  
- Runs fully on Arduino-based automation  
- Budget-friendly & student approved™

---

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time dual-axis-ish solar tracking  
- Automatic blind control  
- LDR-based light sensing  
- Servo motors that move smoother than my life  
- Low power, low cost, low stress (almost)

## ⚙️ Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO  
- 4× LDR sensors  
- 4× 10kΩ resistors  
- 2× SG90 servo motors  
- 1× Servo/DC motor for blinds  
- L298N motor driver  
- Lithium-ion battery  
- Solar panel  
- Jumper wires + breadboard

## 🏗️ How It Works (Human Version)
1. LDRs read the light intensity from different directions.  
2. Arduino compares all readings like it's judging a talent show.  
3. Servos rotate the panel toward the brightest direction.  
4. When sunlight is ✨too extra✨ → blinds close.  
5. When it chills → blinds open.  
6. System runs automatically. You just stand there and take credit.

## ▶️ How to Run
1.Open Arduino IDE.
2.Plug in your UNO.
3.PRAY.
4.Upload the code.
5.Watch the servos vibe with the sun like they’re in a slow-mo music video.

Use it, remix it, flex it.  
Just don’t blame me if you fry a servo.
(Yall better have a good circuit before blaming my code for not running)
